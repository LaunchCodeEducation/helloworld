How to approach this course
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

In this course, we'll use the popular programming language Python as a vehicle to learning foundational concepts in computer programming. While we have to choose a language out of necessity, the core concepts you learn here are universal, and will be found in nearly every other programming language you encounter.

Learning to code
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Everybody learns differently, we have found some common patterns and best practices that greatly assist everybody in the course of learning to code.

**Immediate practice**

When learning a new concept, try it out right away. Even if you are copying a code sample character-by-character with no understanding of what is going on, the practice of writing and running code early and often will result in greater retention and understanding.

**Experimentation**

There are a lot of rules that one must follow when coding. However, the focus should not be on memorization of rules, but on the ability to expected behavior of code, and debugging when expected behavior deviates from the resultant behavior.

Experimentation leads to greater intuitive understanding, and the ability and willingness to be flexible and break things. When learning something new, instead of answering the question, "I wonder what happens if...", by turning to the Internet, simply try it out! Make a hypothesis, test it, and then understand what happened and why (turning to a reference at this point, if necessary).

**Repetition**

A large part of learning to code is akin to muscle memory. Your mental coding muscles will be quicker to recall details of syntax if you've recently used those details. The longer you go without exercising a snippet of coding knowledge, the harder it is to recall. In programming, we want to free our minds from the tedium of recalling details so we can focus on the larger aspects of problem solving and strategy.. So practice early and often!
